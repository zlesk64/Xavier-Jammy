# Xavier-Jammy

NOTICE: Running the 22.04 rootfs generated by these scripts on the AGX Xavier with a CTI Rogue carrier will boot and most things will work. However there are still some things that don't quite work yet, see the releases page for the list of current functionality.

These are scripts to assist with creating a Ubuntu 22.04 rootfs for use on the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier. The nv_build_samplefs.sh, nvubuntu_samplefs.sh scripts and there configuration files are from the Jetson Linux 36.4.3 Driver Package. I have been building the rootfs for a Jetson AGX Xavier with the Connect-tech Rogue carrier board using Connect-tech's BSP for L4T 35.4.1. Unfortunately I don't have the developer kit carrier board for my Jetson so I can't test how well this will work with that kernel and binaries. 

Some of the nvidia l4t 35.4.1 debian packages require libssl1.1 which was deprectated in ubuntu 22.04. Currently I'm installing libssl1.1 manually as part of of the rootfs generation in the nvidia scripts.
